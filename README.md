# 2D-Car-Game-Using-Ursina-Game-Engine

2D car game is basically a two dimensional grapical racing game in which a car is racing through other cars on road. one can control the movement of the car using 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' keys (to move forward, left, backward, right respectively).

This is very simple project in which i use 'Python' and 'Ursina'. Ursina and python make it quite easy to make this simple game 50 lines of code. There are assests in resouce folder. Also one can get assests from 'opengameart.org'.

# Ursina Game Engine

Powered by Python

Ursina makes it easier to develop games, visualizations and other kinds of software.
The concise API combined with the power of the Python programming language,
makes life easier for the developer so they can focus on what they are making.

Things you won't miss from other game engines:

    • Waiting for your code to compile
    • The editor crashing and possibly losing your work
    • Not being able to fix engine bugs or add features
    • Overly verbose code
    • Uncustomizable workflow
    • Waiting for imports
    • Long build times
    • Revenue cut or subscription fee
Useful Features

    • Reload code/textures/models while in-game
    • Automatic import of .psd and .blend files
    • Play in fullscreen while developing
    • Easy to use mesh class for making procedural geometry
    • Lots of included procedural 3D primitives
Platforms

    • Windows
    • Linux
